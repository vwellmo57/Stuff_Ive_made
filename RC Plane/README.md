# Overview
The RC Plane project is more of a learning experience that happened over multiple projects. Each plane has it's own goal from fly to beat a record. This is the only project that on this list that I've done with a partner (Philip Breen). We have been working on planes for out entire time in high school. I'm going to go plane by plane and talk about each one. 

# The First Plane
The first plane we made was a very quick and dirty prototype. It was made out of foamboard and other materials we found around the lab. It sort of flew under it's own power but due to high wind and a propeller that flew off it crashed and was completley destroyed. 

# The First Wood Plane
The next plane we made was made out of laser cut wood. It was ok but had major issues with thrust to weight. This caused to plane to be unable to fly under it's own power. We had been working on this version for about a year and got tired of working on it so we decided to go for it and hand launch it. It crashed. After the crash a certain teacher drove it through the halways and broke both wings on the language department walls. 

# The Next Wood Plane
The next wood plane was worse. It started off on a good note with a solid design but midway through we realised the balance was super far off. Our "soulution" was to put a 2x4 on it, this was a terrible idea. The plane because way to heavy and had no chance of flying under it's own power. It was scraped. 

# The Foamboard Planes
The foamboard planes were a last ditch effort to make something fly. We used a design from the FliteTest youtube channel. It flew and was a huge confidence boost. The next planes was our own design but very similar. Just before school got canceled for Covid it had it's last flight.
