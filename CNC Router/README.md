# CNC Router
## Intro
In August of 2020 I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_atw3e0nIrg&pp=sAQA) video. It looked like a very cool project and I was interested in the basics of CNC control and machining. The router is fundamentaly and trim router mounted to 3 computer controlled axis. I bought the plans go into building.   


## The Build
The router is made from aluminum tube and 3d printed parts. The aluminum was bought from a local welding supply and the parts were printed on my 3-D printer. The first part of the build consisted of printing all of the parts, I had one printer, an ender 3, and some of the parts took up to 3 dayts to print so it took a few weeks to get everything printed.

After everything was printed I used a miter saw to cut the Aluminum to lenght and used threaded rod to make a frame.

After the frame was constructed I drilled and tapped holes to attach the liniar railes. These rails allow for very percise liniar movments in one axis.

## Conclusion
This project was mentally exhausting as the scale was near the limit for me personally, I am glad I took it on. I believe that I came out the other end as a better engineer and I learned a lot, both about drift trikes and about how to learn. Even though it didn't go great I still made something very cool and got the confidence to take on other projects. I had never used an angle grinder or wired and engine before this and I just had to teach myself how to do those things. I got much better at using Google to find information when it's not easily avalible.
