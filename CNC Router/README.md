# CNC Router
## Intro
In August of 2020 I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_atw3e0nIrg&pp=sAQA) video. It looked like a very cool project and I was interested in the basics of CNC control and machining. The router is fundamentaly and trim router mounted to 3 computer controlled axis. I bought the plans go into building.   


## The Build
The router is made from aluminum tube and 3d printed parts. The aluminum was bought from a local welding supply and the parts were printed on my 3-D printer. The first part of the build consisted of printing all of the parts, I had one printer, an ender 3, and some of the parts took up to 3 dayts to print so it took a few weeks to get everything printed.

After everything was printed I used a miter saw to cut the Aluminum to lenght and threaded rod to make a frame.

The trike is powered by a pitbike engine that has an electric start. Power is transfered via chain with a gear ratio of about 1:2. The entire axle is keyed with no differential, this works out because the tires do not have much traction so if the rotational difference is to great they can slide. Below is a picture of the engine with the carb on top.

The frame goes from the downtube to a piece of steel tube and to a steel square in the back that hold the drive components. There is also a stringer from the rear of the fram to the downtube to add rigidity. It can be seen in the picture below.

The wheels sat in pillow block bearings that were self aligning. These bearing were mounted to the side of the rear frame. 
## Conclusion
This project was mentally exhausting as the scale was near the limit for me personally, I am glad I took it on. I believe that I came out the other end as a better engineer and I learned a lot, both about drift trikes and about how to learn. Even though it didn't go great I still made something very cool and got the confidence to take on other projects. I had never used an angle grinder or wired and engine before this and I just had to teach myself how to do those things. I got much better at using Google to find information when it's not easily avalible.
