# Drift Trike
## Intro
The drift trike was easily the most abitious project I have ever undertaken (at time of writing), I've tackled more difficult projects but with more support and experince. The trike is based off a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMn8NqbCkDA) by Colinfurze but his documentation is lacking in my opinion so alot of the design descisions were made along the way with alot of luck involved. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTxULThjy0A) I made goes into more detail. 

## The Build
The trike was built from April to Augest of 2020, the long timeline is due in part to shipping lead times for some parts as well as money. I was also not sure of if something would work so I would not order more parts until I made something work. I wasn't terribly confident that it would work so I was stressed for most of the build. The biggest struggle was finding parts and engine wiring. The engine wiring is easy if you know what parts do what but I didn't so even with a diagram I struggles alot but it was a great learning experince. 

## Conclusion
This project was a failure in many ways, it worked but I was mentaly exhausted so I sold it for a loss and moved on. Although the projects was a falirue I don't regret taking it on for a few reasons. I belive that I came out the other end as a better engineer and I learned alot, both about drift trikes and about how to learn. Even though it didn't go great I still made something very cool and got the confidence to take on other projects. I had never used and angle grinder or wired and engine before this and I just had to teach myself how to do those things.
