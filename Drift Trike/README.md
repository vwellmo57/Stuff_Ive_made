# Drift Trike
## Intro
The drift trike was easily the most ambitious project I have ever undertaken (at the time of writing), I've tackled more difficult projects but with more support and experience. The trike is based on a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMn8NqbCkDA) by Colinfurze but his documentation is lacking in my opinion so a lot of the design decisions were made along the way with a lot of luck involved. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTxULThjy0A) I made goes into more detail. The trike was built from April to August of 2020, the long timeline is due in part to shipping lead times for some parts as well as money. I was also not sure if something would work so I would not order more parts until I made something work. I wasn't terribly confident that it would work so I was stressed for most of the build. The biggest struggle was finding parts and engine wiring. 


## The Build
The trike is made from the downtube and front fork of a bmx and a custom steel frame. The steel should be welded together but I didn't have welder acess so I used bolts, this resulted in a fram with a bit more flex than is ideal but it was ok.

## Conclusion
This project was a failure in many ways, it worked but I was mentally exhausted so I sold it for a loss and moved on. Although the project was a failure I don't regret taking it on for a few reasons. I believe that I came out the other end as a better engineer and I learned a lot, both about drift trikes and about how to learn. Even though it didn't go great I still made something very cool and got the confidence to take on other projects. I had never used an angle grinder or wired and engine before this and I just had to teach myself how to do those things.
