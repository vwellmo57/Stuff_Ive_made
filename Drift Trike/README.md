# Drift Trike
## Intro
The drift trike was easily the most ambitious project I have ever undertaken (at the time of writing), I've tackled more difficult projects but with more support and experience. The trike is based on a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMn8NqbCkDA) by Colinfurze but his documentation is lacking in my opinion so a lot of the design decisions were made along the way with a lot of luck involved. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTxULThjy0A) I made goes into more detail. 

## The Build
The trike was built from April to August of 2020, the long timeline is due in part to shipping lead times for some parts as well as money. I was also not sure if something would work so I would not order more parts until I made something work. I wasn't terribly confident that it would work so I was stressed for most of the build. The biggest struggle was finding parts and engine wiring. The engine wiring is easy if you know what parts do what but I didn't so even with a diagram I struggles a lot but it was a great learning experience. 

## Conclusion
This project was a failure in many ways, it worked but I was mentally exhausted so I sold it for a loss and moved on. Although the project was a failure I don't regret taking it on for a few reasons. I believe that I came out the other end as a better engineer and I learned a lot, both about drift trikes and about how to learn. Even though it didn't go great I still made something very cool and got the confidence to take on other projects. I had never used an angle grinder or wired and engine before this and I just had to teach myself how to do those things.
