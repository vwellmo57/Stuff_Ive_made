# Drift Trike
## Intro
The drift trike was easily the most abitious project I have ever undertaken (at time of writing), I've tackled more difficult projects but with more support and experince. The trike is based off a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMn8NqbCkDA) by Colinfurze but his documentation is lacking in my opinion so alot of the design descisions were made along the way with alot of luck involved. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTxULThjy0A) I made goes into more detail. 

## The Build
The trike was built from April to Augest of 2020, the long timeline is due in part to shipping lead times for some parts as well as money. I was also not sure of if something would work so I would not order more parts until I made something work.
