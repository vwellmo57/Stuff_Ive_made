# Mobility Scooter
## Intro
The mobility scooter is a souped-up beast that can hit land speeds of ~30 mph. It is a golden companion mobility scooter that I bought off of Facebook Marketplace.  The drive system is a combination of go-kart parts and a 2kw electric bike motor & speed controller. It has a straight rear axel that rides on pillow block bearings. 


## The Build
The frame of the scooter was modified with additional steel tube and sheet metal for motor mounts. The bearings hold a 3/4 inch go kart axle which attaches to the stock tires. The keyed axel leads to difficulty turning but is very easy to implement.

The electrical system is 4 SLA batteries in sires to get 48V. The 2kw motor and controller came from China. The whole system is wired to a throttle grip for throttle and a key start as well as a revere switch.

Power is transferred with a chain and custom welded sprocket, the alignment is somewhat poor but the motor slop somewhat compensates.

## Conclusion
This project was a blast, it was a nice challenge that pushed me with electronics and welding while not going so far as to be a major stressor. Learning more about brushless motors and drive systems was super useful and I believe that knowledge may come in useful one day. Video below!
