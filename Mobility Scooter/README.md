# Mobility Scooter
## Intro
The mobility scooter is a souped up beast that can hit land speeds of ~30 mph. It is a golden companion mobility scooter that I bought off of Facebook Marketplace.  The drive system is a combinaton of go-kart parts and a 2kw electric bike motor & speed controller. It has a straight rear axel that rides on pillow block bearings. 


## The Build
The frame of the scooter was modified with aditional steel tube and sheet metal for motor mounts. The bearings hold a 3/4 inch go kart axel which attaches to the stock tires. The keyed axel leads to difficulty turning but is very easy to implament.

The electrical system is 4 sla batteries in sires to get 48V. The 2kw motor and controller came from China. The whole system is wired to a throttle grip for throttle and a key start as well as a revere switch.

The frame goes from the downtube to a piece of steel tube and to a steel square in the back that hold the drive components. There is also a stringer from the rear of the fram to the downtube to add rigidity. It can be seen in the picture below.

The wheels sat in pillow block bearings that were self aligning. These bearing were mounted to the side of the rear frame. 
## Conclusion
This project was mentally exhausting as the scale was near the limit for me personally, I am glad I took it on. I believe that I came out the other end as a better engineer and I learned a lot, both about drift trikes and about how to learn. Even though it didn't go great I still made something very cool and got the confidence to take on other projects. I had never used an angle grinder or wired and engine before this and I just had to teach myself how to do those things. I got much better at using Google to find information when it's not easily avalible.
